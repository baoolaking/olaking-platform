-----Objectives & Payment Flow UpdatesObjective Handling Logic


The platform provides five (5) distinct objectives for users to choose from. Only the objective related to social media boosting services is handled fully within the platform.Social Media Boosting Objective


When a user selects “Provide social media boosting services (likes, followers, views, etc.)”, the system will display a list of available boosting plans.


Each plan will include:
   * Service type (likes, followers, views, etc.)
   * Target social media platform
   * Quantity or scope
   * Price
   * Additional delivery notes (if any)
All plans, pricing, and availability are fully managed by the admin through the admin dashboard. Users must select a plan before proceeding to payment.Manual Payment Flow


Payments on the platform are manual and not automated. No Paystack, card payments, or automated bank transfers are used.
   1. After selecting a plan, the user will select a bank account from a list provided by the admin.
   2. The user will transfer the required amount externally using their banking app or USSD.
   3. After payment, the user is redirected to a 'Waiting for Payment Confirmation' screen.
   4. The system polls the backend every 1 minute to check if the admin has approved the transaction.
   5. Admins manually verify payments and approve or reject transactions.
   6. Once approved, the user proceeds to service fulfillment. If rejected, the user is notified and prompted to retry payment.
Other Objectives


When users select any objective other than social media boosting, they are redirected to WhatsApp to continue the conversation manually.
   * WhatsApp Contact: +234 901 799 2518, +234 916 331 3727.
   * This allows for custom discussions, pricing, and requirement gathering outside the platform.

Based on the document scan, the specific feature for the admin to perform CRUD operations on bank accounts (account name and number) and manage their active/inactive status is not explicitly listed under the "Admin Features" section.


You should insert the new requirement as a new bullet point within the Admin Features list, which is part of the "Admin and User Feature Details" section on Tab 3.Suggested Insertion Location and Text


The best place to insert this is after Service and Pricing Management (CRUD).
